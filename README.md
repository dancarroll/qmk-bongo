# Credits 

- [James Incandenza](https://github.com/j-inc) for writing an [initial keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/kyria/keymaps/j-inc/keymap.c)
  with Bongo Cat that served as the main inspiration for this library.
- [@pixelbenny](https://twitter.com/pixelbenny) who provided the art that James used when
  generating the above code.
- [obosob](https://github.com/obosob) who was credited by j-inc for serving as inspiration
  for the animation approach used in the original keymap code.
